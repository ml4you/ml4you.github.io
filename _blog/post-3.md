The state of the art is a synthetic and organized panorama of the work already carried out on a specific subject. Achieving a state of the art involves precise literature work and an analysis of major publications related to the chosen theme.
This is a fundamental step in research, especially for dissertations or theses and sometimes for reports or scientific articles.

## Why is it important to make your state of the art?
The state of the art constitutes an essential preliminary stage which makes it possible to lay the foundations of research upstream and to ensure that it is based on a first solid corpus and reliable hypotheses. As in architecture, it is a question of ensuring the foundations before committing to the construction of the structure.
### An important step for you
At the beginning of a research, it is difficult to precisely define a problem: the state of the art aims to help you clearly identify your subject, to position yourself in a scientific field. It should lead you to choose a promising angle of approach and avoid the risk of embarking on a search that has already been carried out.
### An important step for your readers
It is also about showing your readers the originality and innovative nature of your approach. You must convince them of the usefulness and relevance of your study and demonstrate that you will enrich the state of knowledge in your field.
Write a state of the art in 3 steps
## Step 1: Literature review
A good state of the art must therefore make it possible to begin research with a clear vision of the chosen theme. Whatever your discipline, you must keep in mind that a state of the art is synonymous with revision, examination, and evaluation of sources. It must always be based on already published scientific studies. A good state of the art therefore requires methodical bibliographic research.
### Find references to compile an in-depth bibliography
Before embarking on the actual bibliographic research, you must make a list of the sources available in your field of research. At master's or thesis level, you are certainly already able to distinguish between the various specialized documents: reference works, classics, articles published in peer-reviewed journals, specialized institutional or university sites, archival documents, reports scientists, primary sources/secondary sources, etc.
The current abundance of digital resources should lead you to be particularly vigilant about the documents you consult. You will save considerable time by selecting reliable sources, from serious authors or research centres, by prioritizing the data and immediately discarding unnecessary reading.

## Step 2: Defining the keywords
An effective bibliographic search for the realization of a state of the art necessarily passes by the definition of key words to be inserted in the bibliographic search engines, according to your subject. You will certainly already have names of authors, but you will also necessarily have to do thematic research to flush out more sources.
It is advisable to start from general keywords and gradually refine the theme. This can take time and it is recommended to write down your ideas and all your keywords. To get an overview of this research, you can organize the key words and main ideas on paper, in the form of lists, tables or tree diagrams, with colors or any other visual means that suits you.

Don't overlook the valuable help that other people can give you. Discussion with fellow seminarians, more advanced students can be very helpful. The professors and in particular your dissertation or thesis director are there to guide you. In addition, university libraries generally have a support service to help students and researchers at all stages of bibliographic research.

## Step 3: Reading and writing an effective synthesis
Achieving the state of the art also requires a critical and synthetic reading of your corpus.
### Critical reading
It is important, to optimize your reading, to write reading sheets to keep in mind the essential elements of the source consulted. These summary sheets should include a complete and precise reference to the source, a summary of the main ideas, but also critical questions, personal reflections on this or that aspect of the study. This will allow you, at the end of your readings, to find your way around and above all to establish links between the texts and to classify them methodically. You will also be led, by this meticulous work, to familiarize yourself with scientific terminology and to enrich your specialized lexicon.
### Data synthesis
Once you have finished your reading, you should have a vision that is both global and precise of the main research that has already been carried out around the chosen theme. You should be able to situate yourself in relation to these and more precisely to:
•	know which disciplines have approached your subject, if applicable, according to which method(s);
•	reformulate the questions that structure the studies covered;
•	have understood the main results of the literature and those that are lacking;
•	draw overall conclusions, suggest recommendations;
•	identify your own problem.
## Step 4: Structure a state of the art
A state of the art should not be presented as a loose list of the information collected. These should be presented in a structured way. While there is no fixed rule for structuring a state of the art, several types of logical organization of data can be identified.
The presentation of sources can thus follow various classifications:
•	Chronological. This approach will go from the oldest study to the most recent study. The interest here is to be able to highlight developments in research on a specific subject.
•	Thematic. The aim here is to identify the main themes and questions that structure or underlie the literature reviewed. This organization requires a solid capacity for analysis and synthesis. A thematic classification can, for example, go from the most general to the most specific or even highlight convergences and divergences.
•	Methodological. This consists of distinguishing the different methods or schools of thought that have tackled a subject, by clarifying the specificity of each, their theoretical principles, their strengths, or even their shortcomings.
In certain disciplines (history, ethnology, literature, etc.), you will also sometimes have to distinguish between primary sources and secondary sources.
It goes without saying that your state of the art must include an introduction, but above all a conclusion clarifying the main lessons of your state of the art and clearly formulating the objectives and the problem of your study.
## Transform your state of the art into a scientific article?
In conclusion, achieving a successful state of the art is a long and methodical process. This is an important step that will have a significant impact on the quality of your work, regardless of the level of study. Depending on the case and the context, a state of the art can constitute a part or sub-part of the dissertation or thesis. The icing on the cake, if your state of the art is particularly good, it will be possible to submit it for publication in a specialized journal.
