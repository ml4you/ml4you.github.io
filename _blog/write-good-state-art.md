A state of the art is a comprehensive and structured overview of the existing work on a particular topic. It involves conducting thorough literature research and analyzing significant publications related to the chosen subject. This is a crucial step in research, particularly for dissertations or theses, and sometimes for scientific articles or reports.

## Why is it important to make your state of the art?
Creating a state of the art is important because it provides a critical foundation for research, ensuring that it is based on a solid corpus and reliable hypotheses. It is a vital preliminary stage that enables researchers to establish the groundwork for their work and to identify gaps in the current knowledge. This is comparable to the process of building a structure where it is necessary to ensure that the foundations are strong before beginning the construction. By conducting a thorough analysis of existing literature, a state of the art enables researchers to identify the current state of knowledge on their chosen subject, identify potential research directions, and build a framework for their investigation. This helps to ensure that their research is well-informed, relevant, and likely to yield meaningful results.

### An important step for you
At the start of a research project, it can be challenging to precisely define a problem or research question. The state of the art is designed to help researchers clearly identify their subject, position themselves within their scientific field, and refine their research focus. By conducting a comprehensive review of the existing literature, researchers can identify gaps in the current knowledge, potential areas of investigation, and promising angles of approach. This helps to avoid the risk of embarking on research that has already been conducted and enables researchers to refine their research question in a way that is both relevant and original. Ultimately, a well-crafted state of the art enables researchers to build upon existing knowledge and establish the context for their research, setting the stage for a more productive and impactful investigation.

### An important step for your readers
Another crucial aspect of the state of the art is demonstrating the originality and innovative nature of a researcher's approach. By showcasing how their research builds upon and extends existing knowledge, researchers can convince their readers of the relevance and potential impact of their study. Through a careful review of the existing literature, researchers can identify gaps in the current knowledge and innovative ways to address these gaps. By highlighting the unique contributions of their study, researchers can establish themselves as experts in their field and make a compelling case for the importance of their research. Ultimately, the state of the art serves as a vital tool for demonstrating the potential value of a researcher's work and establishing a strong foundation for their investigation.
Write a state of the art in four steps:

## Step 1: Literature review
To begin research with a clear understanding of the chosen theme, it is essential to create a well-crafted state of the art. Regardless of the discipline, it is important to approach the state of the art as a process of revision, examination, and evaluation of sources, which should always be based on previously published scientific studies. Creating a good state of the art requires methodical bibliographic research to identify key themes, debates, and areas of agreement within the field, as well as potential gaps in the current knowledge. By conducting a thorough analysis of existing literature, researchers can position their research within the broader context of their discipline and identify potential avenues for investigation. A rigorous state of the art is a crucial prerequisite for conducting high-quality research that is relevant, innovative, and impactful.

### Find references to compile an in-depth bibliography
To conduct effective bibliographic research, it is crucial to begin by creating a list of available sources in your field of research. At the master's or thesis level, researchers are typically able to distinguish between various specialized documents, including reference works, classics, peer-reviewed journal articles, specialized institutional or university sites, archival documents, and scientific reports. It is important to remain vigilant in selecting digital resources, given the abundance of information available online. By prioritizing reliable sources from reputable authors or research centers, researchers can save significant time and immediately discard unnecessary reading. Overall, a systematic and discerning approach to selecting sources is essential for creating a strong foundation for research and avoiding wasted effort on irrelevant or unreliable material.

## Step 2: Defining the keywords
To conduct an effective bibliographic search and build a comprehensive state of the art, it is crucial to define and refine key search terms that accurately capture the scope of your research topic. While you may begin with a list of author names, it is also important to conduct thematic research to identify additional relevant sources. Starting with general keywords and gradually refining the search terms can be a helpful approach, and it is recommended to write down all keywords and ideas to keep track of the evolving search strategy. To gain an overview of the research, organizing key words and main ideas on paper in the form of lists, tables, or tree diagrams can be useful. This can help researchers visualize the connections between different concepts and identify potential areas for further investigation. Using color coding or other visual aids can also help streamline the process and make it more efficient.

It is important to seek out assistance and support from others when conducting bibliographic research and building a state of the art. Discussing your research with fellow students or more advanced researchers can be valuable for generating new ideas and identifying potential sources. Your professors and thesis or dissertation director can also provide guidance and advice on developing a comprehensive and effective state of the art. Additionally, many university libraries offer support services to help students and researchers at all stages of bibliographic research, from defining search terms to accessing and evaluating sources. Don't hesitate to take advantage of these resources to ensure the success of your research project.

## Step 3: Reading and writing an effective synthesis
Achieving a comprehensive state of the art requires not only collecting and organizing a corpus of sources, but also engaging in critical and synthetic reading of those sources. This involves carefully analyzing and evaluating each source to determine its relevance, reliability, and potential contributions to your research topic. A critical reading approach also means assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each source and identifying any potential biases or limitations. Through synthetic reading, you can then integrate the information and ideas from each source to develop a cohesive and nuanced understanding of your research topic.

### Critical reading
To optimize your reading and retention of information, it is crucial to develop a system for taking notes on your sources. One effective approach is to create summary sheets for each source that includes a complete and precise reference to the source, a brief summary of the main ideas, critical questions or issues that arise from the source, and your own reflections on the study. By taking these detailed notes, you can better understand the key concepts and arguments presented in each source, and also start to see connections and patterns between them. This systematic approach will help you organize and classify your sources, and also expand your knowledge of specialized terminology and vocabulary.

### Data synthesis
Once you have finished your reading, you should have a vision that is both global and precise of the main research that has already been carried out around the chosen theme. You should be able to situate yourself in relation to these and more precisely to:
•	know which disciplines have approached your subject, if applicable, according to which method(s);
•	reformulate the questions that structure the studies covered;
•	have understood the main results of the literature and those that are lacking;
•	draw overall conclusions, suggest recommendations;
•	identify your own problem.

## Step 4: Structure a state of the art
A state of the art should not be presented as a loose list of the information collected. These should be presented in a structured way. While there is no fixed rule for structuring a state of the art, several types of logical organization of data can be identified.
The presentation of sources can thus follow various classifications:
•	Chronological. This approach will go from the oldest study to the most recent study. The interest here is to be able to highlight developments in research on a specific subject.
•	Thematic. The aim here is to identify the main themes and questions that structure or underlie the literature reviewed. This organization requires a solid capacity for analysis and synthesis. A thematic classification can, for example, go from the most general to the most specific or even highlight convergences and divergences.
•	Methodological. This consists of distinguishing the different methods or schools of thought that have tackled a subject, by clarifying the specificity of each, their theoretical principles, their strengths, or even their shortcomings.
In certain disciplines (history, ethnology, literature, etc.), you will also sometimes have to distinguish between primary sources and secondary sources.
It goes without saying that your state of the art must include an introduction, but above all a conclusion clarifying the main lessons of your state of the art and clearly formulating the objectives and the problem of your study.

## Transform your state of the art into a scientific article?
In conclusion, achieving a successful state of the art is a long and methodical process. This is an important step that will have a significant impact on the quality of your work, regardless of the level of study. Depending on the case and the context, a state of the art can constitute a part or sub-part of the dissertation or thesis. The icing on the cake, if your state of the art is particularly good, it will be possible to submit it for publication in a specialized journal.
