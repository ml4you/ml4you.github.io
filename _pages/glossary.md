# Computational chemistry

### Ab initio calculations: 
Calculations that are performed using basic principles of quantum mechanics, without any experimental data or assumptions.

### Density functional theory (DFT): 
A computational method that uses the electronic density of a system to calculate properties such as energy, structure, and reactivity.

### Force field: 
A mathematical model used to describe the interactions between atoms or molecules in a system.

### Molecular mechanics: 
A method of calculating the energy and forces in a molecular system based on classical mechanics.

### Quantum mechanics (QM): 
A theory that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, and is used to calculate properties such as energy and structure in chemical systems.

### Molecular dynamics (MD): 
A computational method that simulates the motion of atoms and molecules over time, based on classical mechanics and force field calculations.

### Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: 
A computational method that uses statistical sampling to simulate the behavior of a system, based on random input parameters.

### Basis set: 
A set of mathematical functions used to describe the wave function of electrons in a quantum mechanical calculation.

### Gaussian function: 
A mathematical function that describes the shape of a wave function in a quantum mechanical calculation.

### Energy minimization: 
A computational method used to find the lowest-energy configuration of a system, by adjusting the positions of the atoms or molecules until the energy is minimized.

### Ab initio molecular dynamics: 
A type of molecular dynamics simulation that uses ab initio calculations to describe the behavior of a system.

### Hybrid method: 
A computational method that combines two or more types of calculations, such as DFT and molecular mechanics, to improve accuracy.

### Electrostatic potential: 
The electric field generated by a charged particle, which can be used to describe the interactions between molecules in a system.

### Non-bonded interaction: 
Interactions between atoms or molecules that are not directly bonded to each other, such as van der Waals forces or electrostatic interactions.

# Drug design

### Docking: 
A computational method that predicts the binding mode and affinity of a small molecule to a target protein.

### Ligand: 
A small molecule that binds to a target protein and modulates its activity.

### Receptor: 
A protein that binds to a ligand and mediates its biological activity.

### Molecular dynamics simulations: 
A computational method that simulates the motion of atoms and molecules over time to predict the behavior of a system.

### Virtual screening: 
A computational method that uses molecular docking or other techniques to identify potential drug candidates from a large database of compounds.

### Pharmacophore: 
A set of chemical features that are necessary for a ligand to bind to a receptor and produce a biological response.

### Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR): 
A computational method that predicts the activity of a compound based on its chemical structure and the activity of similar compounds.

### Homology modeling: 
A computational method that predicts the structure of a protein based on its sequence similarity to a known protein structure.

### Fragment-based drug design: 
A method of drug design that involves the identification of small fragments that bind to a target protein and the subsequent assembly of these fragments into a larger molecule.

### Lead optimization: 
The process of modifying a lead compound to improve its potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic properties, or other desirable characteristics.

### Drug-likeness: 
A set of physicochemical properties that are commonly found in approved drugs, used to evaluate the potential of a compound to become a drug.

### Target validation: 
The process of demonstrating that a target protein is biologically relevant and is a suitable target for drug discovery.
