## Allosteric: 
From the Greek allos meaning other, allosteric drugs bind elsewhere on the protein surface. Their action is indirect: they affect protein activity by changing the conformation at the second binding site.
## Assay Development:
The process by which an assay, with suitable reprodicibility and dynamic range, is established.
## ATP:
Adenosine triphosphate is the main molecular energy currency of cells.

## Enumerate:
A chemo-informatic technique which takes a chemical scaffold and collections of pendant structural groups as input and automatically generates the structures for all combinations thereof.
## Enzyme:
A protein that acts as a catalyst for a specific biochemical reaction through binding of a substrate to its active site.
## GPCR:
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are proteins embedded into membranes via seven transmembrane domains which detect signalling molecules outside the cell and subsequently activate intra-cellular responses.
## Hit:
A chemical starting point for a drug discovery program.
## Hit Identification:
The process by which a hit for a given target is discovered.
## Ion Channel:
Plasma membrane embedded proteins which facilitate the movement of ions across membranes. 
## Lipophilicity:
Lipophilicity (from Greek lipos “fat” and filikos “friendly”), refers to the ability of a compound to dissolve in lipids and lipid-like substances.
## Medicinal Chemistry:
The scientific discipline involved in discovering new chemical compounds for their use as medicines.
## Metabolism:
Drug metabolism is the breakdown of drugs by specialized enzymes in living organisms. 
## Metabolite:
A modified drug formed after administration from the action of metabolic enzymes from the respective organism.
## NCE:
New Chemical Entity is term used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to mean a drug who’s active ingredient has not been previously approved.
## Optimization Parameters:
Optimization parameters are properties of molecules which need to be improved (or maintained) in order to progress a molecule from a hit to a lead and to a drug candidate.
## Oral Bioavailability:
The percentage of the administered dose of a drug which is absorbed into the bloodstream.
## Orthosteric:
From the greek orthos meaning straight, upright, right or correct, orthosteric refers to drugs which bind at the active site, competing with the natural substrate or ligand.
## PPI:
Protein-protein Interactions (PPIs) are contacts between interfaces of two proteins.
## PROTAC:
A proteolysis targeting chimera is a bifunctional organic molecule consisting of two binder portions connected via a linker. PROTACs bind a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ligase protein inducing ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the POI. PROTACs are a type of proximity inducing drugs.
## Proximity inducing drugs:
Molecules which simulatneously bind two proteins resulting in one of the proteins, the protein of interest (POI), becoming a substrate for the catalytic activity of the other (see PROTACs).
## Selectivity:
Selectivity (one of the most important optimization parameters for small molecules) is the difference in potency of the drug candidate for its target versus all off-targets.
## Small Molecule:
A low molecular weight (below 1500 Daltons) organic molecule which is used to perturb biological systems with the goal of becoming a medicine.
## Structure-based Drug Design:
An approach to drug design which uses a combination of 3D structural information, computational approaches and computer graphics.
## Target:
Also drug target, is the biologcal molecule (most often a protein) that a drug binds to, resulting in a disease altering effect.
## Target Identification:
The process by which a drug target is implicated as a causal factor in a disease.
