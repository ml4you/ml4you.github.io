Welcome! I am a Ph.D candidate in Computational Chemistry at the Laboratory of Innovative Technologies (LTI) at the [National School of Applied Sciences](http://ensat.ac.ma/Portail/), [Abdelmalek Essaadi University](http://www.uae.ma/website/), Tetouan, Morocco. My current research focuses on computational drug discovery of natural products as lead candidates for the management of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Parkinson's disease.

In my work, I am involved in the early stages of drug discovery development, which includes target identification, validation, and selection. I primarily work on multi-target-directed drugs, which involves finding drugs with potential simultaneous activity against multiple targets involved in a particular pathway, such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

My expertise also includes high-throughput virtual screening using both ligand-based approaches (such as similarity search, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, machine learning, and convolutional neural networks) and structure-based approaches (such as molecular docking, conformational sampling, binding affinities, and protein-ligand interactions). Additionally, I conduct molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of the drug-target complex, including RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface, hydrogen bonds, per-residue energy decomposition, umbrella sampling, and free energy perturbations.
