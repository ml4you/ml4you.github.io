Welcome! I am a Ph.D Student in Chemoiformatics at the laboratory of Innovative Technologies (LTI) at the [National School of Applied Sciences](http://ensat.ac.ma/Portail/), [Abdelmalek Essaadi University](http://www.uae.ma/website/), Tetouan, Morocco. My Ph.D projetcs revolves on the computatioanl drug discovery of natural products as lead candidates for the management of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, Parkinson's disease. The main steps in the early stages of a drug discovery development project consist of:
   * Target identification, validation and selection: I mainly work on multi-target-directed drugs which consists on finding drugs with potential simultaneous activity against multiple targets involved in a particular pathway, e.g: oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.
   * High-throuput virtual screening:
        * Ligand-based virtual screening (similarity search, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure activity relationship, machine learning and convolutional neural networks)
        * Structure-based virtual screening (molecular docking, conformational sampling, binding affinities, protein-ligand interactions)
   * Molecular dynamics simulations (RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface, hydrogen bonds, per-residue energy decomposition, umbrella sampling, free energy perturbations)
  
**Programming language:** Python, Bash, LaTex  
**Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, RDkit, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc...  
**Molecular docking:** AutoDock4, AutoDock Vina, Glide   
**Molecular dynamics simulations:** Gromacs, Amber, Desmond  
**Free energy calculations:** gmx_mmpbsa, g_mmpbsa, prime_mmgbsa
