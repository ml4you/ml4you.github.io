**Abstract**  
Monoamine Oxidase B is considered a successful target for developing antiparkinsonian drugs. Due to the side effects of current MAO-B inhibitors, there’s an urgent need for novel potent and highly selective MAO-B inhibitors. A recent study has shown that coumarins tend to be more selective towards MAO-B than MAO-A when connected to a hex-5-ynyloxy chain at position 6 in contrast to their C7-isomers. The present study describes the mode of interaction of the C6 and C7-substituted coumarin isomers characterized by their difference in selectivity towards MAO-B through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations in an effort to elucidate the structural components and molecular interactions that may be responsible for MAO-B selectivity. Three isomeric coumarin pairs connected to ether chain at position 6 or 7 were taken from the literature and modelled according to their IUPAC nomenclature. Molecular docking study revealed one π- π stacking interaction with Tyr-326 in common between the selective coumarin C6-isomers. Resulting complexes of one isomeric coumarin pair that displayed the highest selectivity shift towards MAO-B were subject to 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations study to analyze the stability of the docked complexes. Molecular dynamics revealed that the C7-isomer is relatively stable in both MAO isoforms through the simulation duration, whereas the C6-isomer deemed unstable for MAO-A which may be due to the bulky Phe-208 residue in MAO-A. Our results might be applied for further development and optimization of coumarin derivatives into a successful drug against Parkinson’s disease.
