abstract: 'Parkinson’s disease is considered the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. It is described by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the mid-brain. For many decades, L-DOPA has been considered as the gold standard for treating Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms, however, due to the decrease of efficacy, in the long run, there is an urgent need for novel antiparkinsonian drugs. Caffeine derivatives have been reported several times for their neuroprotective properties and dual blockade of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and adenosine A2A receptors (AA2AR). Natural products are currently attracting more focus due to structural diversity and safety in contrast to synthetic drugs. In the present work, computational studies were conducted on natural product-like caffeine derivatives to search for novel potent candidates acting as dual MAO-B inhibitors/AA2AR antagonists for Parkinson’s disease. Our findings revealed two natural products among the top hits: CNP0202316 and CNP0365210 fulfill the requirements of drugs acting on the brain. The selected lead compounds were further studied using molecular dynamics simulation to assess their stability with MAO-B. Current findings might shift the interest towards natural-based compounds and could be exploited to further optimize caffeine derivatives into a successful dual-target-directed drug for managing and halting the neuronal damage in Parkinson’s disease patients.'
